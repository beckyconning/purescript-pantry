# purescript-test-unit

An asynchronous unit test runner for PureScript.

## Usage

```purescript
module Test.Main where

import Test.Unit

main = runTest do
  test "arithmetic" do
    assert "two plus two isn't four" $ (2 + 2) == 4
    assertFalse "two plus two is five" $ (2 + 2) == 5
  test "async asserts" do
    -- run an assert function with a done callback
    assertFn "done callback got a falseness!" \done -> done true
    -- do it again but fail it if it hasn't completed within 100ms
    timeout 100 $ assertFn "yielded false" \done -> done true
```

Run tests using [`pulp test`](https://github.com/bodil/pulp) or just
by compiling with `--main Test.Main`.
